# MERN stack with Graphql

This is a basic mern stack project using Graphql. 

I used GraphQL for learning how it works, how can I apply it to a project and to see the difference between a GraphQL web service with a Restful web service.

## Features
Allows you to:
- create both clients and projects 
- edit a client and a project 
- delete a project and a client  

## Credits
This project was made following a tutorial from YouTube, you can check it out: [GraphQL Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcLNfwF04Kw)
